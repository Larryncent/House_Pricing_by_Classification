# House_Pricing_by_Classification

The original dataset is from Kaggle Competition - House Prices - Advanced Regression

- Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
- With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this project challenges predict a price range indicating how high the house price is, instead of the final price of each house. Hence, this project becomes a classification problem for house pricing instead of a regression one.
